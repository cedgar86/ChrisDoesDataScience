# Predicting Heart Disease Risk

This project focuses on predicting the risk of heart disease using machine learning models. It utilises a dataset from Kaggle containing 2022 survey data collected by the CDC, which includes various health attributes. The goal is to predict whether a person is at risk for heart disease based on their medical history, lifestyle factors, and other health data.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the dataset to ensure it is ready for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting relevant features that contribute to predicting heart disease risk.
- **Model Training**: Evaluating several classifier models to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Addressing class imbalance using the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) algorithm to improve model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the models' performance.
- **Visualisation**: Developing visualisations to display heart disease risk across different U.S. states and other relevant insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for building the models and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for building models and evaluations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualisation and charting.
- **SMOTE**: For handling class imbalance during model training.
