# Predicting Heart Disease Risk

This project focuses on predicting the risk of heart disease using machine learning models. It utilizes a dataset with various health attributes to predict whether a person is at risk for heart disease based on their medical history and other factors.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the dataset to ensure it is ready for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting relevant features that contribute to predicting heart disease risk.
- **Model Training**: Building machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using different metrics to evaluate the model's performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for building the models and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for building models and evaluations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
